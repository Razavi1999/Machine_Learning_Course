    \lr{To determine the Bayesian decision rule and the error of classification based on the given class-conditional probability distributions, we can use the Bayes' theorem and the minimum error rate criterion. }

\lr{
Given:
- Class \( w_1 \) with the class-conditional probability distribution 
\newline
\( P(x | w_1) = \frac{3}{2} \) if \( 0 < x < \frac{2}{3} \) else 0.

- Class \( w_2 \) with the class-conditional probability distribution 
\newline
\( P(x | w_2) = \frac{3}{2} \) if \( \frac{1}{3} < x < 1 \) else 0.
}

\lr{
The Bayesian decision rule states that we should classify an observation \( x \) to the class that maximizes the posterior probability, which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:
}

\[ P(w_i | x) = \frac{P(x | w_i) \cdot P(w_i)}{P(x)} \]

where:
- \( P(w_i | x) \) is the posterior probability of class \( w_i \) given observation \( x \).
- \( P(x | w_i) \) is the class-conditional probability distribution of class \( w_i \).
- \( P(w_i) \) is the prior probability of class \( w_i \).
- \( P(x) \) is the total probability of observation \( x \), which can be calculated as \( P(x) = \sum_{i} P(x | w_i) \cdot P(w_i) \).

\lr{The error of classification can be calculated as the probability of misclassification, which can be expressed as:}

\[ P(\text{error}) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \min_i [P(w_i | x)] \cdot P(x) \, dx \]

\lr{
In this specific case with the given class-conditional probability distributions and assuming equal prior probabilities (i.e., \( P(w_1) = P(w_2) = \frac{1}{2} \)), we can apply the Bayesian decision rule to determine the optimal decision boundary and calculate the error of classification based on the provided information.

    \begin{enumerate}
\item Given a test point $x$, find the nearest neighbor in the training set for each class.
\item Assign the test point $x$ to the class of its nearest neighbor.
\item Calculate the error probability by considering all possible test points and their correct class labels.
\end{enumerate}

The error probability of the nearest-neighbor classifier can be calculated as follows:

Let:
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(w1)$ be the prior probability of class $w1$
\item $P(w2)$ be the prior probability of class $w2$
\item $P(x | w1)$ be the conditional probability density function of observing $x$ given class $w1$
\item $P(x | w2)$ be the conditional probability density function of observing $x$ given class $w2$
\item $d(x1, x2)$ be the distance metric between two points $x1$ and $x2$
\end{itemize}

The error probability for binary classification using the nearest-neighbor classifier is given by:
\[ P(error) = P(w1) \times P(error | w1) + P(w2) \times P(error | w2) \]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(error | w1) = \int_{x} (P(w2 | x) \times P(x | w1)) dx$
\item $P(error | w2) = \int_{x} (P(w1 | x) \times P(x | w2)) dx$
\end{itemize}
